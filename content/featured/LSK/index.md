The project involves creating a tomato disease classifier that uses Convolutional Nueral Networks to detect the type of leaf disease present in a tomato plant. A user can upload a picture of a tomato to a React frontend website which sends the request to a FastAPI backend via nginx. Finally, I deployed the system to AWS ec2 webserver
